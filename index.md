I have received M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering: Robotics from the University of Michigan in 2017. Prior to that, I had obtained my B.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Rochester with high distinction. I am currently working at Baidu intelligent driving group as research & development engineer. My work at Baidu is to develop motion planning algorithm for self-driving car. 

My ultimate goal is to solve the robotics problems, including motion planning, control and machine learning, to create intelligent robot. My main research interest focuses on creating algorithm for robot motion. My projects, including robotics and machine learning, can be found <a href="https://zhxiaoyu218.github.io/projects/" target="_blank"> here </a>
