I have received M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan in 2016. I holds a B.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Rochester. 

My ultimate goal is to solve the robotics problem, including planning, control and mechine learning, to create intelligent robot. My main research interest is to create algorithm for robot motion. My projects, including robotics and machine learning, can be found <a href="https://zhxiaoyu218.github.io/projects/" target="_blank"> here </a>
