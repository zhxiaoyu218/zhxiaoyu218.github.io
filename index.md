I have received M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering: Robotics from the University of Michigan in 2017. Prior to that, I had obtained my B.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Rochester with high distinction. After I graduated from Umich, I was working as a research and development engineer at Intelligent Driving Group in Baidu.

My research interest is to create the motion planning and control algorithms for the autonomous robot to physically interact with the world. In addition, I also study another robotics problems, such as SLAM and computer vision. My research goal is to further develop the motion planning and control algorithm for the autonomous robot by focusing on adaptability and efficiency. My projects, including robotics and machine learning, can be found <a href="https://zhxiaoyu218.github.io/projects/" target="_blank"> here </a>
