            This is the first autonomous robot I built. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The goal of this project is to navigate a course of twelve ordered and oriented waypoints under autonomous control and not collide with any of the obstacles. This project is based on the TurtleBot robot using ROS/C++.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this system:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Implemented the EKF SLAM algorithm that make robot to know where it is and where obstacle is after action. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Developed a motion planner that was capable of navigating to waypoints in space using state lattice planner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Implemented the measurement models based on the beam model and use laser-scanner sensor from Microsoft Kinect. 
                </li>

            </ul>
