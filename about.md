Making a robot is my dream after I saw the video of ASIMO, the humanoid robot from Honda Motor Co. Inc, at my high school.  After my first-year undergraduate study, with more knowledge on engineering, I realized that building such a robot, like ASIMO, is an incredible challenge. It involves the most advanced technology in many scientific fields like mathematics, physics, motion, computer vision, etc. Besides, an advanced robot also requires advanced hardware.  In my senior year at the University of Rochester, I developed my first intelligent robot, which is advised by Prof. Thomas Howard. Unlike the traditional robot, it recognizes the world and moves to the particular location.


Some fields in robotics, like motion planning, control, computer vision, AI, and machine learning are real problems that can help society move forward. The robotics application, such as the self-driving car is still under researching although it has run on the road, and humanoid robot acts like a human still have not left the top research labs in the world. In fact, the task most humans perform without thinking is still a very hot area of research and very interesting. Robots manipulation on objects within a complex, dynamic and unconstrained environment That’s why the robotics problem is worthy enough to spent a person’s life entire life developing the technology and search for the answers  

Research interests
My research is focused on robot navigation, particularly my interests are within Path Planning and Perception and how to combine both into new solutions for robotics. The full autonomy milestone for robots has not arrived yet, we are slowly closing the gap, however there are still many hindrances, such as uncertainty, scalability and reliability.

During my thesis, I studied dynamic environments, highly uncertain due to the pedestrians involved. Under these conditions, complex situations arise under the interaction with people, where known path planning techniques provide poor solutions. My goal was the study and development of new prediction approaches, aiming to obtain a more intelligent robot motion behavior and introducing predictive reasoning into the planning scheme.

Later as a post-doc, I incorporated uncertainty into planning solutions, where it naturally leads to risk-aware plans. Due to the unpredictable nature of pedestrians, a perfect accuracy on prediction is not feasible. Hence, it makes sense to calculate plans on adversarial scenarios, leveraged by probability distributions, as an effective way to avoid potentially dangerous situations. Ensuring for instance an average of 99% of success rate is a great result in academia but it is a poor result if we think on long-term and safe deployment of robots. This represents the main reason why we should be interested in alternative and divergent ways to express and operate under uncertainty.
