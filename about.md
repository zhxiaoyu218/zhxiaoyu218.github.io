Making a robot is my dream after I saw the video of ASIMO, the humanoid robot from Honda Motor Co. Inc, at my high school.  After my first-year undergraduate study, with more knowledge on engineering, I realized that building such a robot, like ASIMO, is an incredible challenge. It involves the most advanced technology in many scientific fields like mathematics, physics, motion, computer vision, etc. Besides, an advanced robot also requires advanced hardware.  In my senior year at the University of Rochester, I developed my first intelligent robot, which is advised by Prof. Thomas Howard. Unlike the traditional robot, it recognizes the world and moves to the particular location. I still remember the moment, I was chasing the robot when planning module has the bug, look at the robot bump the cone when it cannot recogize the cone, ..... I'd like to have robot move with my program. 


Some fields in robotics, like motion planning, control, computer vision, AI, and machine learning are real problems that can help society move forward. The robotics application, such as the self-driving car is still under researching although it has run on the road, and humanoid robot acts like a human still have not left the top research labs in the world. In fact, the task most humans perform without thinking is still a very hot area of research and very interesting. Robots manipulation on objects within a complex, dynamic and unconstrained environment That’s why the robotics problem is worthy enough to spent a person’s life entire life developing the technology and search for the answers
