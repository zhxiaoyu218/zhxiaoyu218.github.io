Making a robot is my dream since I saw ASIMO, the humanoid robot from Honda Motor Co. Inc, at my high school.  After my first-year undergraduate study, with more knowledge, I realized that building such an autonomous robot is an incredible challenge. The robot, like ASIMO, involves the most advanced technology in many scientific fields like mathematics, physics, motion, computer vision, etc. Besides, an advanced robot also requires advanced hardware.  In my senior year at the University of Rochester, I developed my first real autonomous robot, which is advised by Prof. Thomas Howard. It is rich enough to introduce me most the component of the autonomous robot: it observes, it reasons, and it acts. Unlike the traditional automatic robot, it recognizes the world and moves to the particular location.  In these field of robotics, I am interested in "acting" most. I cannot give an academic reason for this interest. The reason might be that I had defined the field "robotics" is to act in the physic world. Otherwise, I would like to call it artificial intelligence agent. This is even true after I studied the other field at Umich.  I think some course I studied can also support my future research.  For example, GPU programming introduces another approach to improve the efficiency; the deep neural network can extract more feature. 


After I graduated from Umich, I was working as a research and development engineer at Intelligent Driving Group in Baidu. My main work at Baidu is to develop a motion planning algorithm for autonomous-driving vehicles. Moreover, I also presented a novel trajectory prediction algorithm. With this experience, I think it still needs time and technics to reach full autonomy, which is required to the most robotics application. So I believe the autonomous driving car is not safe enough and current technic might be still not be able to solve the problem. Therefore, I decided not to develop such autonomous robot at the industry, but to research on the algorithm for the autonomous robot.


Everybody talks about how intelligent robots can change the future and how they will be doing the work for human. In fact, we are even far away from full autonomy.  Some tasks that humans perform without thinking still really hard to the robot. And some motion tasks alone are already hard enough for the modern autonomous robot system. It is a complex task, and humans actually finish more than one tasks in a short period: they think, they act and they learn. Unlike the traditional motion approaches, that you set a sequence of joint values of the manipulator, it needs to adapt for different environment and objects. These hard tasks are real problems that can help society move forward. That’s why the robotics problem is worthy enough to spend a person’s life entire life developing the technology and search for the answers.
