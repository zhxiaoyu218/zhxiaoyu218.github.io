#### My story
Making a robot is my dream since I saw ASIMO, the humanoid robot from Honda Motor Co. Inc, at my high school.  After my first-year undergraduate study, with more knowledge, I realized that building such an autonomous robot is an incredible challenge. The robot, like ASIMO, involves the most advanced technology in many scientific fields like mathematics, physics, motion, computer vision, etc. Besides, an advanced robot also requires advanced hardware.  In my senior year at the University of Rochester, I developed my first real autonomous robot, which is advised by Prof. Thomas Howard. It is rich enough to introduce me most the component of the autonomous robot: it observes, it reasons, and it acts. Unlike the traditional automatic robot, it recognizes the world and moves to the particular location.  In these field of robotics, I am interested in "acting" most. I cannot give an academic reason for this interest. The reason might be that I had defined the field "robotics" is to act in the physic world. Otherwise, I would like to call it artificial intelligence agent. This is even true after I studied the other field at Umich.  I think some course I studied can also support my future research.  For example, GPU programming introduces another approach to improve the efficiency; the deep neural network can extract more feature. 


After I graduated from Umich, I was working as a research and development engineer at Intelligent Driving Group in Baidu. My main work at Baidu is to develop a motion planning algorithm for autonomous-driving vehicles. Moreover, I also presented a novel trajectory prediction algorithm. With this experience, I think it still needs time and technics to reach full autonomy, which is required to the most robotics application. So I believe the autonomous driving car is not safe enough and current technic might be still not be able to solve the problem. Therefore, I decided not to develop such autonomous robot at the industry, but to research on the algorithm for the autonomous robot.

#### Prospective to robotics
Robotics is, indeed, the future and the automation dream will be a reality. However, we are currently light years away from full autonomy even though everyone talks about how intelligent robots can change the future and how they will be doing the work of humanity. Several tasks that humans perform without thinking are difficult for robots to perform. Motion tasks alone are considerably challenging for the modern autonomous robot system. These difficult tasks are real problems that, if solved effectively, can move society forward. Therefore, I am convinced that the robotics problem is worth devoting immense effort to develop the requisite technology and determine the needed answers. 

#### Prospective to thinking
In the book “Think like an Amateur, do as an Expert,” Prof. Takeo Kanade introduced how he feels about good research. His idea is the method I have been studying in the past six years in my universities. As an amateur, I constantly learn from seminars and conferences about my research interest and different fields. The innovations will become outdated, while the state of art algorithm could be part of the past, but their ideas toward the solutions are constantly worthy of studying. “Think like an Amateur” means thinking freely and unbounded within our expertise to generate ideas. However, to obtain real results, to make theory work precisely, or a system work correctly, the knowledge skill of experts is necessary. Therefore, I broadened the theoretical knowledge and practical scientific skills in multiple disciplines.
