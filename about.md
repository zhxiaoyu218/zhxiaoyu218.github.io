Why I am interested in robotics?

The answer is straightforward. I am big fans of the robot when I was the child. I thought that develop robot is only the dream until my high school teacher showed me the video of ASIMO, the humanoid robot from Honda Motor Co. Inc.  After this, develop a robot is no longer being my dream, it became my goal. After my first year of study, with more knowledge on engineering, I realized that building such a robot, like ASIMO, is an incredible challenge for the scientist. It involves the most advanced technology in many scientific fields like mathematics, physics, motion, anatomy, etc.  Unfortunately,  I have no idea which area of robotics I wanna study. I wanted to develop the whole robot system, including hardware, software, control, vision, and reason. 


Some fields in robotics, such as motion planning, AI, and computer vision are real problems that can help society really move forward The robotics application, such as self-driving car is still under researching although it has been run on the road, and humanoid robot acts like a human still has not left the top research labs in the world. In fact, the task most humans perform without thinking is still a very hot area of research and very interesting. That’s why the robotics problem is worthy enough to spent a person’s life entire life developing the technology and search for the answers
